[![Travis CI][1]](https://travis-ci.org/kcjengr/qtpyvcp) [![pypi version][2]](https://pypi.org/project/QtPyVCP/) [![LinuxCNC 2.8][3]](https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc) [![Chat on IRC ][4]](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.kiwiirc.com/hazzy) [![Chat on Matrix ][5]](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#qtpyvcp:matrix.org) [![Chat on Gitter ][6]](https://gitter.im/kcjengr/qtpyvcp) [![Chat on Discord ][7]](https://discord.gg/463hMhd)

QtPyVCP is a Qt and Python based framework for building virtual control panels for the LinuxCNC machine control.

The goal is to provide a no-code, drag-and-drop system for making simple VCPs, as well as a straightforward, flexible and extensible framework to aid in building complex VCPs.

## Dependancies

* LinuxCNC master (2.8~pre)
* Python 2.7
* PyQt5 or PySide2

QtPyVCP is developed and tested using the LinuxCNC Debian 9 x64 (stretch) [Live ISO](http://www.linuxcnc.org/testing-stretch-rtpreempt/). It should run on any system that can have PyQt5 installed, but Debian 9 x64 is the only OS that is officially supported.
